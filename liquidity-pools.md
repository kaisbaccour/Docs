# Liquidity Pools

The KuSwap dex can only function when there is adequate liquidity to facilitate trades; for example, if no one wanted to sell you KCS, it wouldn't matter how much you wanted to swap for some. 

Providing liquidity will earn you LP Tokens, which will earn you rewards in the form of trading fees for ensuring the exchange always has liquidity.
